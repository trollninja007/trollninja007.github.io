<center><h1>Life Is Hard</h1></center>
<center><p>You start sweating as you start to hear the screaming get louder and louder.</p>
<p>The screams are getting worse by the minute, it doesn't really sound like a girl anymore..</p>
<p>It sounds more like someone is ripping her vocal cords out, the scream is inhumane, you have never heard anything like it before.</p>
<p>
And all of a sudden, the forest goes silent. Not a single noise can be heard.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, something starts moving. You can hear the dead leaves being crushed and tossed around. This thing is coming. And it's coming fast.</p>
<p>You can't take it anymore. Whatever this thing is, it doesn't sound like it's running on two legs. A split second later, a monstrous creature appears before you.</p>
<p>Your palms start sweating and you fall under your own weight.</p>
<p>At this point there's nothing more you can do, you've succombed to the beast's intense aura and beg it to end it fast.<p>
